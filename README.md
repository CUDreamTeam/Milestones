# Milestones

Final Submission - Milestone 7
There are different repos under the CUDreamTeam organization that hold different parts of our project. We have a website hosted on git hub and the code is on CUDreamTeam/CUDreamTeam.github.io repository. 
There are addtional files in this google drive: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jguvJ9sHJk6ZlRcx_CHCxyn6MS8gwx90 
HexGame.zip is a zip folder of the unity project. Some of the files were too big to put on github. HexGameMac.app.zip is a zip folder of the mac build folder WindowsBuild.zip is a zip of the windows build folder. To run the program extract the files from the zip that corresponds to the build for the platform that you want. Run the file from the folder. You do not need to have unity downloaded. Works best on windows.
